# My Communication Style

- Tone: friendly, confident, and future-focused.  
- Vocabulary: clear, precise, and visual; avoids jargon.  
- Structure: short sentences, present tense.  
- Focus: creativity, technology, and user experience.  
- Never over-explain; trust the audienceâ€™s intelligence.  
- Use real examples over abstract theory.  
- Speak as a partner, not a salesperson.  
- Always connect design choices to human impact.
